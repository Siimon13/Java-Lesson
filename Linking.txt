Create a class that returns keeps on returning a random item from a list until it runs out. Each return shouldn't be returned until the user is ready. For example, after returning the first item the program should pause until the user wants it to return the next item. Recommended to look up Fisher Yates for the random algorithmn. Of course, you can use another random algorithm. Now to the items, the items should contain two stirng values, a name and a description. When it returns the item, it will display both name and value and take that item out of the list. I should be able to easily go into the code to make my own code, or you can make a UI to add the item.
